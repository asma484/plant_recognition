# Plant Disease Recognition

This repo contains a few small projects for recognizing plant diseases. I created them as part of a Data Science course.

## Included Notebooks

- `03_preprocessing_plant_diseases.ipynb` – Data preprocessing  
- `09_decision_tree_on_plant_diseases.ipynb` – Decision Tree model  
- `10_LeNet_plant-diseases.ipynb` – Simple CNN (LeNet)  

## Usage

The notebooks can be opened in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.  
Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`.
